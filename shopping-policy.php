<br/><br/>Some of the greatest journey starts with the smallest of steps. One such journey began in 1983 , inside a small shop or studio. Started out as nothing, but with an aspiring dream and great vision.
<br/><br/>We began with negligible outfits and 1 or 2 brands and set out to fulfill our destiny to give the Indian fashion industry a taste of traditional fashion that was luxurious and at the same time affordable. We are based in Gujarat but cater to clients globally: including prominent personalities from Bollywood and T.V shows.
